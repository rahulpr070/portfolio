      <p className="description fredoka">
      Improving accessibility and The user interface.

      <h2 className="subtitle fredokamedium">Design Thinking Process</h2>
      <p className="description fredoka">
      The end goal of the process is to create a product, service, or experience that people want (desirability), has real potential to become useful (visibility), and can easily or conveniently be built in terms of technology (feasibility).
      Itâ€™s important to stay focused on one phase at a time,and iterate fast.

      <h2 className="subtitle2 fredokaregular">Empathy</h2>
      <p className="description">
      Interviews:
      We regularly have customer meetings where we investigate current workflows, how each user thinks, the environment in which they work, pain points, expectations, and more. Our interviews are not limited to India, we conduct interviews in different parts of the world.
      </p>

      <h3 className="subtitle2">User Survey & Analysis</h3>
      <p className="description">
      Conducting the user survey have given us some surprise.
      </p>

      <img src={Image2} alt="User Analysis" className="image-large" />

      <p className="description">
      After we went through the survey , we identified a couple of 
      Important things:
       <ul>
        <li>Only 3.7 percentage of people have used the community feed page.</li>
        <li>Surprisingly 35% people are using videos instead of reading.</li>
        <li>For those who are multitasking, playing video is a better option for them.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 className="subtitle">Define</h2>
      <p className="description">
      To define, or re-define, the problem or challenge, a point of view (PoV) formula can help: PoV = persona + need + insight.
      </p>
      <h3 className="subtitle2">Persona</h3>

      <img src={Image3} alt="Persona" className="image-large" />

      <h2 className="subtitle">Ideation</h2>
      <p className="description">During the ideation phase, we conducted an internal meeting involving key stakeholders and technical experts who actively participated in the interviews.
      
      </p>

      

      <h3 className="subtitle2">Problem</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>How can we enhance the utilization of the community feeds page to better serve our users?</li>
        <li>What is the optimal number of videos we can produce for each article?</li>
        <li>What strategies can we employ to enhance the user experience for multitaskers?</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 className="subtitle2">Solution</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Instead of utilizing the community feeds page, let's integrate social media links within the app, such as a Telegram group, where users can submit their ideas for publication by the admin.</li>
        <li>Rather than producing videos, let's consider incorporating a robotic voice feature for every article, enhancing the accessibility and user experience.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 className="subtitle">Information Architecture</h2>

      <img src={Image4} alt="IA" className="image-large" />

      <h2 className="subtitle">Defining UI (Wireframes)</h2>
      <p className="description">
      Once we had identified the main screens, we allocated them among ourselves, allowing each team member to focus on a specific set of screens. As the screens evolved and reached a more stable state, we transitioned into a more collaborative approach. In my role, I took responsibility for designing the Home, Articles, and Videos (AIM TV) screens.
